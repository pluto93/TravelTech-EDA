# TravelTech-EDA

The TravelTechDataset2024Reduced2.csv was provided by Joshua Ryan-Saha and his team at Edinburgh’s Data-Driven Innovation and Tourism initiative, under the TravelTech Scotland network. This dataset was created to analyse festival and tourism patterns within Edinburgh, specifically aiming to understand audience behaviors at festivals, such as the Edinburgh Fringe.

**Purpose of Collection:**
The primary goal behind collecting and sharing this dataset is to support research into audience behaviors and to address broader challenges in tourism and event management. By analysing audience flows, genre preferences, and timing, researchers and festival organizers can make informed decisions on optimizing event schedules, improving accessibility, and enhancing the audience experience. Additionally, the dataset helps to explore innovative ways to tackle issues like “choice anxiety,” which festival-goers often experience due to the vast number of events available.

**Key Data Types and Variables:**
The dataset contains critical variables that allow for a rich analysis of audience journeys:

Ticket Information: ticket_type identifies types of tickets, helping to segment audiences and their preferences.
Customer and Transaction Details: Fields like customer_id, customer_postcode, transaction_id, and transaction_datetime provide anonymized insights into booking behaviors and audience location distribution.
Event Information: Attributes like event_code, event_name, programme_genre, and subgenre categorize each event by genre and style, supporting genre-based analyses and emotional journey mapping.
Venue Information: Details on venues and spaces, such as venue_name and space_name, help in assessing venue popularity and audience flow across festival locations.

## Process
I first performed *data cleaning and preprocessing*, then generated some *descriptive statistics*, and finally created *3 interesting visualisations*.
